Structured data on elites - which is required for large-scale construction of elites' professional, familial, and education peer networks - is extremely limited\n","2.   Training data for automated structured IE are also very scant.\n","\n","**Solution:** To address this challenge of data scarcity, this pipeline create a synthetic dataset for fine-tuning LLMs for structured IE task from a small amount of data .\n","\n","<u>The objective</u>: Using LLMs and human correction to create a dataset containing pairs of biographical documents & corresponding JSON outputs for fine-tuning the appropriate LLMs for structured IE.\n","\n","Specifically, the following workflow gathers a small number of strutured JSON records of elites' education, career, and family details and then use them to *generate (1) additional synthetic JSONs, (2) synthetic biographies, and (3) paraphrased biographies.*\n","\n","This is to ensure that the fine-tuning data contain a diverse set of examples, with both original and synthetic JSONs as well as different (paraphrased) version of the factually correct biographies.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zG_d4D8D5lrF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Process Overview**\n","**Original data:** 102 JSON records of real, factual political elites in *Vietnam* & *Russia*\n","\n","**The strategy contains several steps**\n","1.

He held many important positions in the state and government apparatus such as Chairman of the State Council of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam from 1987\\u20131992 (equivalent to President) and Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1986\\u20131987 (equivalent to the now Deputy Prime Minister).\\n\\nHis real name is Vo Toan, born on August 7, 1912, in Tam My village, Phu Quy commune, Tam Ky district (now Khuong My village, Tam Xuan I commune, Nui Thanh district), Quang Nam province. His father was Vo Nghiem, a patriotic Confucian scholar, later also a Communist Party member in the cell where his son was the secretary, posthumously awarded the title of Martyr by the Vietnamese state. His mother was Nguyen Thi Than, later awarded the title of Heroic Vietnamese Mother by the Vietnamese state .\\n\\nVo Chi Cong's early career began in 1939 when he served as the Secretary of the Tam Ky District Party Committee in Tam Ky, a position he held until 1940. The following year, he took on a leadership role in the Central Regional Party Committee (in the Central region), which he maintained until 1942. He then became the Secretary of the Quang Nam Provincial Party Committee from 1942 to 1943.\\n\\nIn October 1943, due to the betrayal of a provincial committee member named Cao Tien Khai, he and a number of provincial committee officials, Nguyen Sac Kim and Le Ba, were arrested by the French colonial government. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, later reduced to 25 years in prison in Hoi An, then transferred to imprisonment in Buon Ma Thuot, where he remained until 1945.\\n\\nAfter his release, he joined the Vietnam People's Army and held a leadership position in Military Region 5, located in the South Central region, from 1946 to 1950. He continued to work in the region, serving as the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee in Quang Nam and Da Nang from 1952 to 1954.\\n\\nVo Chi Cong's subsequent roles included Vice Party Secretary of the Vietnam People's Army in Military Region 5, from 1955 to 1960, and Deputy Secretary of the Central Office for Southern Vietnam, also known as the Central Office for the South, from 1961 to 1974. During this period, he also held the position of Vice President of the National Liberation Front (NLF) in the Southern Region from 1962 to 1974.\\n\\nIn 1975, Vo Chi Cong became the Vice Chairman of the Committee of Party and Government Representatives in the south, a position he held for that year. The following year, he took on the role of Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, which he maintained until 1986. From 1978 to 1979, he served as the Minister of Agriculture.\\n\\nVo Chi Cong's career reached the highest point when he was elected to the position of Chairman of the State Council from 1987 to 1992. Under his direction, the State Council reviewed and promulgated important laws paving the way for the country's economic development and international integration, such as the Land Law, the Export Tax Law, the Foreign Investment Law, etc.\\n\\nHe was also a member of the Central Advisory Council for the CPV (Communist Party of Vietnam) from 1991 to 1997. In December 1997, he, along with Mr. Nguyen Van Linh and Mr. Pham Van Dong, resigned from the position of Advisor to the Party Central Committee and retired according to the regime.\\n\\nVo Chi Cong married Phan Thi Ne (1915\\u20131969), from Tam Hiep commune, Tam Ky city. She was also a revolutionary and was posthumously awarded the Second Class Independence Medal .\\n\\nVo Chi Cong passed away in 2011, at the age of 99.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":

He was of Tay ethnicity, a significant minority group in Vietnam's northern region. Quang's career was marked by extensive military service and leadership within the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), shaping his legacy as a key figure in Vietnam's post-war era.\n","\n","#### Early Life and Education\n","\n","Nguyen The Quang embarked on his military education at the Whampoa Military Academy in China, attending from 1951 to 1953. This period was crucial as it laid the foundational military skills and ideological training that would define his career. He further advanced his military education at the prestigious Frunze Military Academy in the USSR for a brief period in 1967, gaining exposure to broader military strategies and strengthening international ties that were vital during the Cold War era.\n","\n","#### Military Career\n","\n","Quang's military career began earnestly upon his return from Whampoa. By 1954, he had assumed a leadership role within the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), quickly ascending through its ranks. From 1955 to 1956, he served as the Head of the VPA in the Hanoi Special Zone, and between 1956 and 1958, he was both a commander of Division 31 and the head of the Military Committee in Quang Nam and Da Nang. His leadership was pivotal during the formative years of the VPA when Vietnam was engaged in both internal consolidation and external conflicts.\n","\n","In 1959, Quang took on further responsibilities in South Central Vietnam as a leader in the Military Region 5. He continued to climb the ranks, leading the Division 312 from 1961 to 1966 in the North. After a brief period back at school in 1967, he returned to Vietnam to serve as the Vice Commander of the Ta Ngan Military Region from 1968 to 1970, and then as Commander of the Viet Bac Military Region from 1971 to 1976. His military acumen was recognized with successive promotions: he became a Colonel in 1968, Major General in 1984, Lieutenant General in 1990, and Senior Lieutenant General in 1994.\n","\n","#### Political Involvement\n","\n","Parallel to his military career, Quang was deeply involved in the political landscape. From 1977 to 1982, he served as the Secretary of the Military Region 4's Military Party Committee, demonstrating his adeptness in both military and political spheres. He then commanded the same region until 1985. His political career peaked when he became the Political Commissar of Military Region 1 in 1986, a position he held until 1990, followed by a role as Commander of the same region until 1996.\n","\n","In the later years of his career, from 1997 to 2001, Quang transitioned to broader political roles, joining the CPV's Secretariat, where he helped shape party policies and directions. His political influence was further extended when he served concurrently as the Vice President of the State Council and the Chairman of the National Assembly's Council of Nationalities from June 1997 to July 1998.\n","\n","#### Retirement and Legacy\n","\n","Nguyen The Quang retired in 2002, concluding a career that spanned over five decades across military and political spectrums. He passed away in 2005, leaving behind a legacy characterized by steadfast leadership and dedication to Vietnam's development. Quang's life was also marked by his relationships with colleagues such as Bui Thi Cuong, Đo Ba An, and Hoang The Cuong, among others, who were integral to his career from as early as 1951.\n","\n","He was survived by family members including his brothers Nguyen Van Ly and Nguyen Van Lan, who also contributed to various capacities within Vietnam's social and political frameworks.\n","\n","Nguyen The Quang's life story is a testament to the complexities of Vietnamese leadership during the 20th century, reflecting both the challenges and triumphs faced by the nation during a pivotal era of its history. His contributions remain significant in the annals of Vietnam's military and political heritage.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_prompt2 = \"\"\"\n","You are an expert historian and

He hailed from the Tay ethnicity, one of the many ethnic groups in Vietnam. Quang's military and political career spanned several decades, reflecting his significant role in Vietnam's modern history. He passed away in 2005.\n","\n","Quang's early education occurred at the prestigious Whampoa Military Academy in China from 1951 to 1953, where he was a student during the early years of his career. This period was crucial for acquiring the military skills that later defined his career. He furthered his military education by attending the Frunze Military Academy in the USSR for a brief period in 1967.\n","\n","Upon returning from Whampoa, Quang joined the Vietnam People's Army, quickly ascending through various leadership positions. From 1954 to 1955, he held a leadership role within the Army, and from 1955 to 1956, he served as the head of the Hanoi Special Zone. His responsibilities expanded as he became the head of the Military Committee and Commander of Division 31 in Quang Nam and Da Nang from 1956 to 1958.\n","\n","Between 1959 and 1960, Quang held a leadership position in Military Region 5, located in South Central Vietnam. His leadership continued as he led Division 312 in the North from 1961 until 1966. After a year studying at the Frunze Military Academy in 1967, he returned to Vietnam and became the Vice Commander of the Ta Ngan Military Region from 1968 to 1970.\n","\n","The 1970s and 1980s were a period of further advancement for Quang. He commanded the Viet Bac Military Region from 1971 to 1976, and from 1977 to 1982, he served as the Secretary of the Military Region 4's Military Party Committee. He then commanded Military Region 4 from 1983 to 1985. His career peaked as he became the Political Commissar (1986-1990) and subsequently the Commander (1991-1996) of Military Region 1, located in the Northeast of Vietnam.\n","\n","Quang's military career was marked by a series of promotions reflecting his growing influence and capabilities. He was promoted to Colonel in 1968, Major General in 1984, Lieutenant General in 1990, and finally Senior Lieutenant General in 1994.\n","\n","Transitioning to a more politically oriented role, from 1997 to 2001, Quang was a leading figure in the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), specifically in the Secretariat. Concurrently, from June 1997 to 2002, he served as the Vice President of the State Council and also chaired the Council of Nationalities of the National Assembly from June 1997 to July 1998.\n","\n","Nguyen The Quang retired in 2002, concluding a long and distinguished career in both the military and political arenas of Vietnam. He had two brothers, Nguyen Van Ly and Nguyen Van Lan, who also might have been influenced by his significant contributions to the nation.\n","\n","Throughout his career, Quang worked alongside numerous colleagues, including Bui Thi Cuong, Đo Ba An, Hoang The Cuong, Hoang Ngoc Minh, and Hoang Đinh Hai, first mentioned in 1951. Another colleague, Bui The An, was first mentioned in 1955.\n","\n","Nguyen The Quang's life and career reflect the complexities and dynamics of Vietnam's political and military environments through the mid to late 20th century.
